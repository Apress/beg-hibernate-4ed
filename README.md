## Issues

* Chapter 8 has changed for recent versions of Hibernate. The current `master` branch uses updated dependency 
versions and matches the book in most important respects, but caching is disabled via Hibernate configuration 
(the cache configuration is commented out.) A correction is on its way as soon as time permits.
